1. Why we dropped? What is difficulty?
=> This is a CNN computer vision model. First challenge is about data. Data collection and data processing for creating model is bit difficult. Then a lot of coding is required with respect to image segmentation and image bounding box like calculating coordinates of bounding box, coordinates of center of palm, etc. Implementing this is Hadoop/Spark system is very difficult. PySpark libraries are available but data processing is very challenging with respect to image/video data. And there are not lot of development with respect to libraries available to implement a coumpter vision model. So we can not try different model algorithms to improve accuracies.

2. Why this project?
=> This is a famous customer churn Data Science project. So a lot of materials are available with respect to data processing and data modelling. With help of resources, it will be easy to implement the map reduce program for the same. In this project Data Science techniques like Data analysis by statistics, data visualization will be done. It will be very simple to use this model for predictions while real time implementation.

3. How is this different from previous one?
=> There is a big difference between this one and earlier one. Earlier one is an AI based Computer Vision project which involves image data preprocessing and dynamic video data handling for predictions. This one is Machine Learning based Data Science project which involves data preprocessing dealing with simple data which can be preprocessed with techniques like Statistics, etc. More trails can be done with respect to applying different kind of ML models to find out the best model.
The churn prediction project has a big data set available (12gb), where as earlier one was having very small size of data available.

4. What is assured of its completion?
=> As mentioned, with respect to huge available materials, there will be no challenges with respect to Data Science tasks. Dealing an AI project like computer vision in Python is very straight forward as compared with PySpark. Whereas this Data Science project is as easier to implement in PySpark as in Python. There is very less work to be done on this use case with respect to full end-to-end implementation.
